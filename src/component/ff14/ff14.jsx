        Final Fantasy 14's journey has been a long road full of disappointment.
        Launching in 2010 to an overwhelmingly negative response, Square Enix
        refused to give up and rebuilt the whole game with a new team. The
        second iteration, A Realm Reborn, has done a better job of rekindling
        the love fans had for Final Fantasy better than any recent game in the
        series. It's at once unflinchingly dedicated to following in World of
        Warcraft's footsteps while also introducing a host of refreshing
        ideasâ€”the best being the innovative class system.
