        No other MMO has had a greater impact on the genre and the entirety of
        videogames as a whole quite like World of Warcraft. Though it might be
        getting on in years, World of Warcraft continues to surprise.
        Shadowlands, its latest expansion, returns to the glory of WoW's early
        years through a mix of ambitious new systems and one of the best
        endgames the MMO has ever had.
