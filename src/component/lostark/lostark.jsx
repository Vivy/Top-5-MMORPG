        If you like your combat over-the-top and fast-paced, MMOARPG Lost Ark
        might be your new best friend. The Korean MMO differs from the rest of
        the games on this list by going down the action-RPG route, with an
        emphasis on spectacular abilities that make you feel like you're showing
        off with every attack.
