      <span>
        The original Guild Wars would have been firmly in the PvP section of
        this list, but for the 2012 sequel ArenaNet took a broader approach,
        giving us an MMO with the diversity and scale of World of Warcraft, but
        with a mountain of quirks and activities that are all its own. One
        moment you're playing through one of several story campaigns, then
        you're bouncing around an area participating in events like a charr
        heavy metal concert or a religious festival so you can earn enough
        chillies to buy a weapon that looks like a microphone, travelling into a
        videogame-themed dimensions to earn prizes, or duking it out in a
        persistent PvP battlefield where three servers collide.
